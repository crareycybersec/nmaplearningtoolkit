# nmaplearningtoolkit

A elegant way to learn the core of Networkmapper

- Initially copy the code from [code.txt](code.txt) and save it with the file name nmaplearninngtoolkit without any extensions

- After that change it to a executable file by changing the permissions **chmod 777 nmaplearningtoolkit**

- Then move the file to **/usr/bin** and then paste it

[Toolkit1]:  one.png "Toolkit Screenshot"
[Toolkit2]:  two.png "Toolkit Screenshot"
[Toolkit3]:  three.png "Toolkit Screenshot"

- Now open the terminal and type nmaplearningtoolkit you will see a list of options like this 

![entering the toolkit][Toolkit1]

- After if you select any one of the option in this case I've chosen one

![demonstrating tcp scan][Toolkit2]

- Then a tcpdump terminal will be opening for analysis and for understanding of what's happening

![opening tcpdump][Toolkit3]

That's it enjoy your day and play with it
